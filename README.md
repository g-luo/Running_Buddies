# Running_Buddies

## Overview
A web app to connect community runners. Runners can either organize an event by uploading a route and run type, or they can join events via an events database. This app uses Firebase for database management.

## Motivation

Runners often perform better through the companionship and encouragement of fellow runners. As an avid runner myself, I found solo running to be lonely and monotonous. However, it can be difficult to organize running events on today's social media networks:

1) individuals often lose motivation to run if there is a long gap between the posting of the event and the event itself
2) events may not reach their intended audience (runners)

Essentially, Running Buddies is designed to be a simple events organizer specifically for the local running community. 

## Installation

You can run this application using any web browser!
